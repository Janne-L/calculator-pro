	4. Find the limit of the sequence, function 

**TRIGONOMETRIC**

	1. Trigonometric expand: sin(2x) -> 2sin(x)cos(x)
	2. Trigonometric reduce: 2sin(x)cos(x) -> sin(2x)
	3. Trigonometric to exponent: sinh(x) -> (e^x-e^(-x))/2

The Calculator does not show the steps to solve the equations, system of equations, derivative... but only for the final result.
Enter **sin(30Â°)** to calculate sine Degree mode

The computer can work in two modes:
- 	Decimal mode: 0.12312312323
- 	Mode fractions: for results with arbitrary precision, for example 9^99999
